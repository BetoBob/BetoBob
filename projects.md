# Project Notes

## To Add

* Minesweeper Bot
  * finish this up! generally seems like a fun project
* Rejection
  * just update the README a little bit; kind of a fun project to show python knowledge
  * in the future, try to make a web interface for this

### School Projects

* Course History

  * include a markdown file about courses I have taken at Cal Poly
  * include images of some projects to given a better idea of what the projects were like
  * include technology stacks used for each project

* 357 and 453 Projects

  * skip the 357 labs, just demo projects like Tar / Memory management
  * only work on improving C projects when I am the interviewing process for a company that uses C in position
  * bare minimum: just upload the source code of these projects to demonstrate that I have knowledge of C programming

* SQL Portfolio

  * show the Seals project documentation (try to make as anonymous as possible)

  * ignore SQL query work; it's too much for a hiring manager to read and I can demonstrate this in:

    1. HackerRank profile

    2. Hotel Project

  * CSC 365 show the Hotel Project (in Java)

    * maybe try to update it to have an actual web interface
    * bare minimum; include complete Java Code for the project to demonstrate Java / SQL understanding

* STAT 331

  * create a new repository where the Yelp API key is no longer public
  * also deactivate Yelp App from API

* 481 Project

  * make 481 Project the default 
  * maybe call it 'Gawalla Project'
  * include a much more descriptive README, maybe a paper on the project (if it exists)

* CSC 430

  * use this to demonstrate functional programming language abilities
  * try to obscure some details to anonyimize the project / avoid plagarism

* Senior Project

  * Add paper to the Github repository about NLTK Book Resource

## Ignore

* CSC 225 
  * assembly knowledge can be demo-ed in CPE 315
  * C knowledge is better demoed with 357 and 453 source code
* CPE 315
  * **problem:** can't seem to find the original project specs for these labs
  * also will probably take a lot of time to update these projects to be readable
  * maybe use the MIPS emulator to demonstrate understanding of low level assembly code

* CPE 349 (Algorithms)
  * this can generally be demoed in code assessments (HackerRank) 

* Rodi-NLP-Project
  * I want to continue working on this project, but the data is too sensitive to share publicly
